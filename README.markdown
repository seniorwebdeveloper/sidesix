# The Side Six Repository 

This is the git repository for Side Six, a web design business in Orange County, California. We are undergoing a lot of site changes in our move to make the site responsive to modern devices.  

While I code this site, I'm also trying out several compass plugins and several different text editors designed for the Mac. So far, Sublime Text 2 rocks pretty hard, but Espresso 2 is great if the site is on a testing server or is live.
