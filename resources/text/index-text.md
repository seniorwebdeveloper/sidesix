My philosophy about design, the web, and everything is: <span class="highlight">stuff should just work.</span> I shouldn't have to flick all over the page when I'm using my phone. That is neither necessary or useful. 

There's a Shaker Philosophy that I try to practice: If you are going to build something, make sure it's both necessary and useful; if it is both necessary and useful, do not hesitate to make it beautiful. That is, pay attention to craft and to details. Apple Inc. has made a pile of money doing just that. 

<span class="highlight">A web site should automatically respond</span> to <span class="highlight">what<span> I'm doing, <span class="highlight">where<span> I'm doing it, and the <span class="highlight">device</span> I'm doing it on. For example if I'm surfing the web on my iPhone in a Starbucks, the web pages should be designed to adapt to an iPhone using a fairly slow connection.

<span class="highlight">### Craftsmanship Is Crucial.</span>

I watched my Great-Aunt Ethel fire eight different guys who wanted to build an addition onto her house one Summer. She had been born in the late 1880's and she kept saying "he didn't know what he was doing." She meant they had no sense of <span class="highlight">quality</span>; that they were not craftsmen and, because of that, they had no business working on her home.

There is a lot of stuff littering the web that was built by people like the guys my Great-Aunt Ethel fired. They can make you a web site for very little money. But if you want to stand out on the web, you should contact a designer that is talking about Responsive Web Design. Give us a try. If it doesn't work out, I'll gladly recommend another craftsman.
