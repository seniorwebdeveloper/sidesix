I love to create stuff. It's why I'm here. If you need a site built from scratch, a new look, help with usability concerns, some copy, an image, a poemâ€¦get in touch.

I really enjoy creating responsive web sites that adapt to the user's device. After all, the web has left the desktop. Smartphones were predicted to out-sell laptops, desktop, and notebook computers in 2012 in the global market. They did that in the last quarter of 2010. Home usage of personal computers fell 20% between 2008 and 2010; traffic to mobile web sites tripled between 2009 and 2010 and then grew 600% in 2010. If you have a web site it has to be able to look great on a variety devices, with a variety of internet connection speeds.

So reach out and contact me. You can fill out the form below; I made it because we live in modern times and all. But, if it were me, I'd use the vCard below and call. I like to speak with the person I might do business with; I'd like to look that person right in the eye.
