This is a small representation of our recent work. Please bear in mind that all web sites should be different. They should be designed around their content. 

With the advent of so many screen sizes and different devices people are using to visit web pages, maybe we can move away from the "web page as print" idea and start making sites which are far more interesting than print. We can forget about making the site look exactly the same on every device because that is no longer possible. That sort of freedom is great for creativity. 

Also, with all those various devices and screen sizes, web sites need to be designed to be responsive; that is they should just adapt to the person's screen size and look good. This is best accomplished with one site and the use of media queries in the stylesheet. Mobile sites, that is a separate site for mobile devices, are a waste of your money and bandwidth. 

The sky is literally the limit when it comes to web sites these days. Therefore, pricing varies wildly depending on what your needs are, what the time frame is, and how many bells and whistles you'd like.  Basically, there are three factors that influence how much a web site costs to build.

1. Time
2. Quality
3. Complexity

Note:
If you're on your smartphone in a coffee shop or an airport with a slow connection, you should revisit this page when you have a faster connection, or you're using your iPad, a laptop, or a desktop computer. That way you can enjoy the images and you won't be frustrated by how long it's taking to download them.  Thanks!
