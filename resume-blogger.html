						<p class="summary">I don't usually recommend companies or products to other people because most lack quality. I do recommend a company  like Apple and its products because I have seen a consistent and remarkable level of quality in the company and its' products over the years. I taught writing for 18 years in Southern California at both a University of California Campus and at a couple of community colleges. One can't really teach writing. Instead I taught quality; I encouraged the students to think critically and to look closely.</p>
