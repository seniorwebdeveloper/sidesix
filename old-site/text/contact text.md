You can take a look at some of our most recent work below. Every person we work with is different because of their wants, needs, and budget. So I'll talk to you about you -- your wants, your likes, what's important to you, your taste in music, all sorts of questions that will seem odd because you just want a web site build. Here's why I take that approach:

 *  [Apple](http://apple.com) has a seriously cool web site.
	*  Almost every item on it is a button, a call to action. 
	* The site is as stylish as the Mac Pro and Apple Cinema display I'm using at this moment.
*  Everyone should have such a site, but not everyone takes Apple's approach to cost. 
 
If Apple thinks people will benefit from a product, they make it and worry about the costs later. The *Human Interface Guidlines* is the most important concept at Apple. Everything is done with the user in mind. They spent millions on their website. 

I'm betting you don't have millions to spend on a web site. I'm thinking you have a budget which will determine just what we can and can't do. 

*   If you don't have a budget and do have millions, good Lord, call me *immediately*. We are going to have serious fun creating a web site. 
*    If you do have a budget, good Lord, call me *immediately*. We are going to have serious fun creating a web site.
